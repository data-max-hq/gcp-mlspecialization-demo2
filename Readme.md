## Business goal and machine learning solution

### Business Question/Goal
The primary business question being addressed in this project is: "How can we predict customer purchase amounts during Black Friday sales to optimize marketing strategies and increase profits?" The goal is to leverage machine learning to understand and anticipate customer purchasing behavior based on various demographic and behavioral factors. By accurately predicting purchase amounts, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts, allocate resources more efficiently, and ultimately increase sales and profitability during high-traffic shopping events like Black Friday.

### Machine Learning Use Case
The machine learning use case for this project involves developing a predictive model that estimates the purchase amount for each customer based on a set of features. These features include:

### Age
City Category
Gender
Marital Status
Occupation
Product Category 1
Product Category 2
Product Category 3
Stay in Current City Years
By analyzing these features, the model aims to predict the purchase amount each customer is likely to spend during the Black Friday sales.

### How the Machine Learning Solution Addresses the Business Goal
The machine learning solution is designed to provide actionable insights into customer purchasing behavior. Hereâ€™s how it addresses the business goal:

* Targeted Marketing Campaigns: By predicting the purchase amounts, businesses can identify high-value customers and target them with personalized marketing campaigns. This increases the likelihood of higher sales conversions.

* Inventory Management: Understanding predicted purchase patterns helps in managing inventory more effectively. Products that are expected to be in high demand can be stocked in advance, reducing the risk of stockouts or overstocking.

* Resource Allocation: Marketing budgets can be allocated more efficiently by focusing on customer segments with higher predicted purchase amounts. This ensures a better return on investment (ROI) for marketing expenditures.

* Customer Insights: The model provides deeper insights into customer behavior and preferences. This can inform future product development and promotional strategies, aligning them more closely with customer needs and preferences.

* Profit Optimization: By optimizing marketing strategies and inventory management, businesses can increase their overall profitability during Black Friday and other peak shopping periods.

### Top-Line Description
This demo presents a machine learning solution aimed at predicting customer purchase amounts during Black Friday sales. The solution leverages demographic and behavioral data to build a predictive model that helps businesses enhance their marketing strategies, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately increase profits. By addressing the business question of how to anticipate customer spending, this project demonstrates the value of machine learning in driving business growth and efficiency during high-traffic shopping events.

Whitepaper Section: Data Exploration
Data Exploration Process
The data exploration process was a critical step in understanding the characteristics of the dataset and making informed decisions about the data preprocessing and model architecture. The exploration was performed using the tensorflow_data_validation (TFDV) library in conjunction with the StatisticGen, SchemaGen, and ExampleValidator components of the TensorFlow Extended (TFX) pipeline. These tools provided comprehensive insights into the dataset's statistics, schema, and potential anomalies

### Tools and Techniques Used

**TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV):** 

* StatisticGen: This component generated descriptive statistics for the dataset, providing insights into the distribution of values for each feature.
* SchemaGen: This component inferred the schema of the dataset, which includes information about feature types, domains, and expected values.
* ExampleValidator: This component validated the dataset against the inferred schema and identified any anomalies or inconsistencies.

### Type of Data Exploration Performed

1. Descriptive Statistics:

* Examined the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for numerical features.
* Analyzed the distribution and frequency of categorical features.

2. Schema Inference:

* Identified the data types (e.g., integer, float, string) for each feature.
* Defined domains for categorical features and ranges for numerical features.

3. Anomaly Detection:

* Detected missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
* Validated that the data adhered to the expected schema.

### Impact on Data/Model Algorithm/Architecture Decisions

The insights gained from the data exploration phase significantly influenced the following aspects of the project:

**Data Preprocessing:**

Implemented normalization for the Purchase feature to handle the wide range of values.
Applied one-hot encoding to categorical features to facilitate their use in the machine learning model.

**Model Architecture:**

Chose algorithms and model architectures that can effectively handle the normalized and encoded features.
Ensured that the model can accommodate the processed data format, leading to better performance and accuracy.

### Conclusion
The data exploration process provided a foundational understanding of the dataset and informed critical decisions regarding data preprocessing and model architecture. By leveraging TFDV and the TFX pipeline components, we ensured that the dataset was thoroughly analyzed and preprocessed, leading to a robust and effective machine learning solution.
